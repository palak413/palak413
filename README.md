# Hey there! 👋 I'm Palak Kumariw

✨ Frontend Developer | ⚛️ React Lover | 🎨 CSS Sorcerer | 🌱 Forever Learning

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I turn coffee ☕ into **clean code** and transform ideas 💡 into interactive web experiences. Whether it's a single-page app or a pixel-perfect design — I'm always building something awesome!

## 🔧 Tech Toolbox

Here's what I’ve been working with lately:

- 🖼️ **HTML** – Structure is everything!
- 🎨 **CSS** – I speak fluent Flexbox and Grid.
- ⚡ **JavaScript** – Logic, DOM, and occasional chaos.
- ⚛️ **React** – My current playground for building slick UIs.

## 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of

🧰 **React Todo App**  
Simple? Yes. Boring? Never. A clean and minimal task manager with real-time features.

🌤️ **Weather Dashboard**  
React + API = fun with weather! Live weather updates with a stylish UI.

🌐 **Personal Portfolio**  
A digital version of me, built from scratch with HTML, CSS & a sprinkle of JS magic.
